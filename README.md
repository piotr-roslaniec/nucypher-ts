# Get Started with Threshold Access Control

This tutorial is a quick way for developers to learn about the Threshold Access Control service. We recommend reading about [Conditions-Based Decryption](https://docs.threshold.network/fundamentals/threshold-access-control/conditions-based-decryption-cbd) (CBD) before starting. CBD is a technology used in Threshold Access Control that allows for data sharing based on certain conditions.

## 1. Install `nucypher-ts`

To start, we need to install the `nucypher-ts` library - A TypeScript library for using access control in the browser. To install it, run the following command:

```
yarn add @nucypher/nucypher-ts
```

## 2. Build a Cohort

Next, we will create a Cohort based on our risk preferences. A Cohort is a group of nodes that work together to control access to data. Threshold and Shares are two parameters used to create a Cohort. For example, a 3-of-5 Cohort needs at least 3 of the 5 members to provide shares in order to access the original data.

To create a Cohort, use the following code:

```javascript
import { Cohort } from '@nucypher/nucypher-ts';

const config = {
  threshold: 3,
  shares: 5,
  porterUri: 'https://porter-tapir.nucypher.community',
};
const newCohort = await Cohort.create(config);
```

In the code above, we provided a `porterUri` parameter. [Porter](https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/application_development/web_development.html#porter) is a web-based service that connects applications to nodes on the network. It acts as an "Infura for TAC". In this example, we used a Porter endpoint for the tapir testnet.

## 3. Create Conditions

We will now specify the conditions that must be met to access the data. In this tutorial, we will require that the requester owns an ERC721 token with a token ID of 5954.

```javascript
import { Conditions } from '@nucypher/nucypher-ts';

const NFTOwnership = new Conditions.ERC721Ownership({
  contractAddress: '0xBC4CA0EdA7647A8aB7C2061c2E118A18a936f13D',
  chain: 5, // tapir uses the Goerli testnet
  parameters: [5954],
});
```

The `ERC721Ownership` condition checks the owner of a given token ID. It can be customized by using the `ownerOf` contract method and comparing it with the requestor's signature. For more information, see the [References](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/threshold-access-control-tac/references/conditions#conditions.erc721ownership) section of the documentation.

There are other Condition [types](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/threshold-access-control-tac/references/conditions), and it is possible combine multiple conditions into a [_ConditionSet_](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/threshold-access-control-tac/references/condition-set)_:_

```javascript
import { Conditions, ConditionSet } from '@nucypher/nucypher-ts';

const conditions = new ConditionSet([
  NFTOwnership,
  // Other conditions can be added here
]);
```

In this tutorial, we will only use a single condition.

## 5. Build a Strategy

We will now combine the `Cohort`, `ConditionSet`, and any other necessary parameters into a [_Strategy_](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/threshold-access-control-tac/references/strategy)_:_

```javascript
import { Strategy } from '@nucypher/nucypher-ts';

const newStrategy = Strategy.create(newCohort, conditions);
```

Next, we will deploy this Strategy to the Threshold Network. To do that, we're going to transact on Polygon Mumbai:

```typescript
import detectEthereumProvider from '@metamask/detect-provider';
import providers from 'ethers';

const MMprovider = await detectEthereumProvider();
const mumbai = providers.providers.getNetwork(80001);

if (MMprovider) {
  const web3Provider = new providers.providers.Web3Provider(MMprovider, mumbai);
  const newDeployed = await newStrategy.deploy('test', web3Provider);
}
```

:warning: Deploying a Strategy requires writing to the blockchain. This requires a wallet funded with testnet MATIC and connection to the blockchain via a `provider`(e.g. MetaMask).

## 6. Encrypt the plaintext

We can now encrypt data using the newly deployed Strategy. This means that future access to this data will be based on the ownership of the specified NFT. To encrypt the data, use the following code:

```javascript
const encrypter = newDeployed.encrypter;

const plaintext = 'this is a secret';
const encryptedMessageKit = encrypter.encryptMessage(plaintext);
```

## 7. Request decryption rights

Finally, we will test the access control service by requesting decryption rights:

```javascript
const decrypter = newDeployed.decrypter;

const decryptedMessage = await decrypter.retrieveAndDecrypt([
  encryptedMessageKit,
]);
```

At decryption time, the requester will be asked to verify their address by signing a message in MetaMask. If they own the correct NFT, the message will decrypt successfully.

For more information about customizing and reusing Cohort, Condition, and Strategy objects, see the [References](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/threshold-access-control-tac/references) page in the documentation.
